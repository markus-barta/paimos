# PAIMOS — Hardening Guide & Reference Architecture

**Owner:** the maintainer (single-person operation as of v2.0).
**Companion docs:** [`THREAT_MODEL.md`](THREAT_MODEL.md) (what must be true), [`CONFIGURATION.md`](CONFIGURATION.md) (every env var), [`DEPLOY.md`](DEPLOY.md) (release + rollback runbook), [`INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md`](INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md) (when something goes wrong), [`CONTINUITY.md`](CONTINUITY.md) (when the maintainer is out).
**Audience:** operators bringing a PAIMOS deployment online. Pre-launch and recurring (every six months, or after material infrastructure change).

---

## 0 · Purpose & scope

This document is the **operator-facing companion** to [`THREAT_MODEL.md`](THREAT_MODEL.md). Where the threat model says *what must remain true*, this guide says *how to make it true* in a real deployment — and *how to verify it*.

Three uses:

1. **Pre-launch hardening pass.** Walk every checklist item in §3 before exposing a fresh PAIMOS instance to users.
2. **Recurring review.** Re-walk the checklist every six months, or after any material infrastructure change (new reverse proxy, new TLS provider, new MinIO bucket, new IdP).
3. **Audit evidence.** A reviewer asks "is this deployment hardened?" — the answer is "here's the checklist; here are the verification commands; here are the outputs."

This guide is **not**:

- A vendor-specific runbook. The reference architecture is reverse-proxy-agnostic; examples use Caddy because that's what `paimos.com` itself uses, but the patterns translate cleanly to nginx / Traefik / Apache.
- A substitute for [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md). That's the inbound disclosure policy; this is the outbound deployment posture.
- An exhaustive list of every defensive measure imaginable. The bar is *defensive measures relevant to PAIMOS's threat model* — see [`THREAT_MODEL.md` §5](THREAT_MODEL.md) for what's deliberately out of scope.

```

**The five non-negotiables:**

1. **TLS at the edge.** PAIMOS does not terminate TLS itself. A reverse proxy must do that. PAIMOS sets `Secure` on cookies when `COOKIE_SECURE=true`, which is meaningful only behind real HTTPS.
2. **Single-port exposure.** PAIMOS exposes one port (`:8888` by default). The reverse proxy is the only thing that should reach it.
3. **`$DATA_DIR` on isolated storage.** Multi-tenant hosts must give PAIMOS its own filesystem space. Encryption-at-rest is the operator's call (see §3.6).
4. **Outbound provider creds in env vars, not on disk.** OIDC / SMTP / MinIO credentials live in env. The OpenRouter API key is the one exception (stored in SQLite by design — admin-set via UI), and that's why the AI assist surface explicitly recommends encrypted FS.
5. **Audit egress.** Stdout audit lines (`audit: ai_action ...`, `audit: session_mutation ...`) are useful only if they're collected. A SIEM / log aggregator is the egress.

**What's optional:**

- **MinIO/S3** — only needed if attachments are used. PAIMOS hides drop zones when unconfigured.
- **SMTP** — only needed for password reset (and only outbound; PAIMOS doesn't receive mail).
- **OIDC** — only needed for SSO. Local password + TOTP works without it.
- **OpenRouter** — only needed for AI assist; default-disabled until an admin enables it.

## 2 · Pre-deployment checklist

Before you `docker compose up` for the first time:

- [ ] **HTTPS certificate ready.** Let's Encrypt via Caddy is the simplest path; internal CA works equally well.
- [ ] **Domain DNS** pointed at the host. The cert renewal flow needs DNS to resolve.
- [ ] **`$DATA_DIR` parent directory** exists on the chosen storage volume.
- [ ] **Encryption-at-rest** decision made: required (per your threat model) or accepted as out-of-scope. See §3.6.
- [ ] **Backup destination** ready: a separate disk, object store, or off-site location. The deploy script (`scripts/deploy.sh`) creates a tarball before every deploy; you need somewhere to keep it.
- [ ] **Reverse proxy configured** with the response-header forwarding documented in §3.1.
- [ ] **Operator user account** on the host has Docker access (`docker compose` permission).
- [ ] **Secret manager** chosen: 1Password / Vault / sealed env file / etc. — wherever your env vars come from. Not the maintainer's clipboard.
- [ ] **Initial `ADMIN_PASSWORD`** generated by a CSPRNG (e.g., `openssl rand -base64 24`) and ready to set on first boot. **Will be rotated immediately after first login** — see §3.2.
- [ ] **Branding decision:** product name, company, email-from per `BRAND_*` env vars in [`CONFIGURATION.md`](CONFIGURATION.md). Default is `PAIMOS`; rebrand on first boot if you intend to.

## 3 · Hardening checklist

The seven domains map roughly to [`THREAT_MODEL.md` §4](THREAT_MODEL.md) invariant groups. Run through every item; record any *deliberate* deviations in your operations log.

### 3.1 · TLS, network, and edge

| Item | Verification | Threat-model invariant |
|---|---|---|
| `COOKIE_SECURE=true` set in env | `docker compose exec paimos env \| grep COOKIE_SECURE` | INV-AUTH-02 |
| Reverse proxy enforces HTTPS; HTTP requests redirect 301 → HTTPS | `curl -I http://your.host/api/health` returns `301` to `https://` | – |
| HSTS header is set on responses | `curl -sI https://your.host/api/health \| grep -i strict-transport-security` | – |
| Security headers present (`X-Frame-Options=SAMEORIGIN`, `nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`) | `curl -sI https://your.host/api/health` | INV-NETWORK §2.1 (PAI-114) |
| CSP-Report-Only sink is configured (or knowingly ignored) | `curl -sI https://your.host/api/health \| grep -i csp` shows the policy; report endpoint is reachable from your CSP `report-uri` if you provided one | – |
| Reverse proxy does not bypass PAIMOS's rate limits (i.e., login / forgot / reset / TOTP-verify still rate-limit at PAIMOS layer) | trigger 6 failed logins from a clean IP; confirm the 6th is rate-limited | INV-AUTH-04 |
| Request body size limit at the reverse proxy (recommended: 32 MiB; PAIMOS attachment cap defaults to 25 MiB) | upload a 100 MiB file via the attachment endpoint; expect a `413` from the proxy before it reaches PAIMOS | – |
| TLS protocol minimum is TLS 1.2 (TLS 1.3 preferred); SSL 3 / TLS 1.0 / 1.1 disabled | `nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 your.host` or `https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/` | – |

### 3.2 · Authentication

| Item | Verification | Invariant |
|---|---|---|
| Initial admin password rotated within 5 minutes of first login | UI: `Settings → Account → Change password` after login; record the rotation in your operations log | INV-AUTH-01 |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var **removed** after the first boot completes | `docker compose exec paimos env \| grep ADMIN_PASSWORD` returns empty | INV-AUTH-01 |
| All admin users have TOTP enabled | UI: `Settings → Users` shows TOTP-enabled flag per admin row | INV-AUTH-05 |
| OIDC is configured **only if** required by the deployment; otherwise disabled (no `OIDC_ISSUER_URL`) | Login page shows or hides "SSO" button accordingly | INV-AUTH-08 |
| OIDC IdP enforces `email_verified=true`; users with unverified email are refused at PAIMOS | trigger an SSO login with an unverified email; expect redirect to `/login?sso_error=email_required` | INV-AUTH-08 |
| Password reset link expiry is the documented 60 min; never extended | `PAIMOS_RETENTION_DAYS_RESET_TOKENS=7` (default; this is post-use audit retention, not link-expiry) | INV-AUTH-06 |
| Rate-limit window observed for login / forgot / reset / TOTP-verify (5 attempts / 10 min / IP+identity) | trigger 6 attempts with bad credentials; expect 429 on the 6th | INV-AUTH-04 |

### 3.3 · Authorization

| Item | Verification | Invariant |
|---|---|---|
| Project access matrix reviewed (`Settings → Permissions` or `GET /api/permissions/matrix`) | every user has the lowest level that lets them do their job | INV-AUTHZ-01 / 02 / 03 |
| No "everyone is admin" anti-pattern | `paimos issue list --assignee admin` returns expected count, not all users | – |
| External-role users (if any) only have portal access; cannot reach internal routes | manual: log in as an external user; navigate to `/projects/1`; expect redirect to `/portal` | INV-AUTHZ-06 |
| New project default access is `editor` for member users (PAIMOS default) — verified to match your operational expectation | first-create-project audit | INV-AUTHZ-05 |
| API keys created by users have scope == that user's role; admin-issued API keys honour the *creator's* role, not the issuer's | UI: `Settings → Account → API keys` (per user); admin can list keys via user-detail page | INV-AUTH-03 |

### 3.4 · Files and uploads

| Item | Verification | Invariant |
|---|---|---|
| Reverse proxy forces `Content-Disposition: attachment` for `*.html`, `*.svg`, `*.htm`, and any user-uploadable type that browsers might render inline | upload an HTML file with embedded JS; download it; expect browser to *download* not *render* | **INV-FILES-03 (PAI-110 still open at the application layer; mitigated at proxy until then)** |
| MinIO bucket access scoped to PAIMOS only (separate IAM credential, not the root credential) | MinIO admin UI: confirm the access key has `s3:GetObject` / `PutObject` only for `${BUCKET}/*` | – |
| Attachment uploads bounded by `BRAND_MINIO_BUCKET` env (default `paimos-attachments`); not a shared bucket with other apps | `MINIO_BUCKET` is dedicated | INV-FILES-01 |
| MinIO + PAIMOS use TLS to each other in production (or share a private network) | `MINIO_USE_SSL=true` if endpoint is on the public internet | – |
| Branding-asset uploads (logo, favicon) restricted to admin role | UI: non-admin user cannot reach `Settings → Visual → Workspace Branding` | INV-FILES-06 |
| Image upload size limit (PAIMOS default ~25 MiB; configurable) sane for your operational context | upload a 30 MiB image; expect `413` | – |

> **Note:** PAI-110 (active-content upload hardening at the application layer) is still open; the proxy-layer mitigation above is the recommended interim. After PAI-110 ships, this row becomes redundant — but the proxy-layer defence is cheap to keep.

### 3.5 · Audit and observability

| Item | Verification | Invariant |
|---|---|---|
| `PAIMOS_AUDIT_SESSIONS=true` (default in v2.0) | `docker compose exec paimos env \| grep PAIMOS_AUDIT_SESSIONS` | INV-AUDIT-03 |
| Stdout audit lines forwarded to a log aggregator | `docker compose logs paimos \| grep "^audit:"` shows lines; aggregator query confirms ingest | INV-AUDIT-01 / 02 |
| Retention windows reviewed and tuned (`PAIMOS_RETENTION_DAYS_*`) | current values match your compliance posture; defaults documented in [`CONFIGURATION.md`](CONFIGURATION.md) | INV-AUDIT-06 |
| Incident-log table seeded for the first incident; not a surprise table on day one | UI: `Settings → Incidents` (admin-only); empty list with "no incidents" empty state | INV-AUDIT-04 |
| AI usage cap reviewed (`PAIMOS_AI_DAILY_CAP_TOKENS`, default 100k/user/day); admin override per user where needed | UI: `Settings → AI → Usage today` shows per-user totals | INV-AUDIT-05 |
| The `audit: ai_action ...` invariant is verified — no prompt or response body leaks into stdout | grep audit lines for substrings of known issue descriptions; expect zero hits | INV-AUDIT-02 |

### 3.6 · Secrets management

| Item | Verification | Invariant |
|---|---|---|
| `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`, `MINIO_SECRET_KEY`, `SMTP_PASS` sourced from your secret manager, never from a checked-in `.env` file | `git log` of your deployment repo shows no `*_SECRET` / `*_PASSWORD` strings | INV-PROV-01 / 02 / 03 |
| OpenRouter `api_key` stored in SQLite; `$DATA_DIR` on encrypted FS if your threat model requires | LUKS / dm-crypt / eCryptfs / FileVault on the storage volume | INV-PROV-01 |
| Rotation cadence: OIDC client secret + SMTP creds + MinIO secret rotated **at least quarterly** unless your provider requires otherwise | rotation entries in the operations log | – |
| API keys (PAIMOS-issued, `paimos_…`) audited every six months; unused keys revoked | UI: `Settings → Users → <user> → API keys`; the recent `last_used_at` column drives the decision | INV-AUTH-03 |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var **never re-set** after first boot (it's first-run-only and ignored if `admin` user exists) | `docker compose exec paimos env \| grep ADMIN_PASSWORD` is empty | INV-AUTH-01 |
| No secret in CI logs, container env dumps, or commit history | `docker compose config` (resolved compose file) does not echo any secret in plain text; CI uses masked vars | – |

### 3.7 · Backups, restore, and disaster recovery

| Item | Verification | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Backup runs on every deploy via `scripts/deploy.sh`; tarball lands in `$BACKUP_ROOT/<UTC-timestamp>/` | inspect the host: `ls $BACKUP_ROOT \| tail -5` shows recent backups | [`DEPLOY.md`](DEPLOY.md) |
| Backup destination is **off-host** (separate disk minimum; off-site preferred) | the host losing its primary disk does not also lose its backups | – |
| Backups include `data.tar.gz` + `manifest.yaml` + the prior `docker-compose.yml` | inspect any recent backup directory | [`DEPLOY.md`](DEPLOY.md) |
| **Restore tested** — at least one successful restore drill against a non-production target | drill recorded in the operations log per [`INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md` §3.3](INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md) | INV-EXPORT-04 |
| RPO target documented (PAIMOS default: 24h ≈ deploy cadence) | operations log | – |
| RTO target documented (PAIMOS default: ~5 min for image-pin rollback; ~15-30 min for full DB restore from tarball) | operations log | – |
| Hard-delete (purge) reviewed as irreversible — operators understand the asymmetry | UI: `Settings → Trash → Purge` is admin-only | INV-EXPORT-04 |

---

## 4 · Environment differences

The same checklist applies to dev / staging / production with these explicit relaxations / tightenings:

| Item | Dev | Staging | Production |
|---|---|---|---|
| TLS termination | optional (`http://localhost:8888`) | required | required |
| `COOKIE_SECURE=true` | unset OK | required | required |
| Initial admin password rotation | not required | required | required immediately |
| TOTP for admin users | recommended | required | required |
| Reverse proxy | optional | required | required |
| `PAIMOS_DEV_MODE=true` (logs reset links to stdout) | OK | **never** | **never** |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var post-boot | may persist for tear-down convenience | removed | removed |
| Audit log forwarding | optional | optional | required |
| Backup destination off-host | not required | required | off-host **and** off-site |
| Restore drill cadence | not required | every 6 months | every 6 months **and** before any risky migration |
| OpenRouter API key visibility | OK to share among devs | scoped to staging | production-only key with separate billing |

The sharpest distinction is `PAIMOS_DEV_MODE=true`: it logs password-reset links to stdout, which makes local development livable when SMTP isn't configured. Per [`CONFIGURATION.md`](CONFIGURATION.md): **never set this in shared staging or production** — the link is a one-shot password reset and anyone with log access can use it.

## 5 · Verification — full deployment audit

A one-pass external audit of a hardened deployment. Run from a clean shell against the live host.

```sh
# 1 · TLS posture
echo "QUIT" | openssl s_client -connect your.host:443 -tls1_2 2>/dev/null | grep -E "Protocol|Cipher"
curl -sI https://your.host/api/health | grep -iE "strict-transport-security|x-frame-options|x-content-type-options|referrer-policy|permissions-policy"

# 2 · Auth posture
# Confirm rate limit kicks in
for i in $(seq 1 6); do
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    https://your.host/api/auth/login -d '{"username":"admin","password":"wrong"}'
done
# Expect: 401 401 401 401 401 429

# 3 · No secrets in container env
docker compose exec paimos env | grep -iE "(password|secret|key|token)" | grep -v "PAIMOS_"
# Expect: empty (or only documented non-secret entries)

# 4 · Audit forwarding
docker compose logs --tail=200 paimos | grep -E "^audit:" | head -5
# Expect: lines flowing; reach into your aggregator and confirm ingest

# 5 · Backup verification
ls -lt $BACKUP_ROOT | head -5
gzip -t $BACKUP_ROOT/$(ls -t $BACKUP_ROOT | head -1)/data.tar.gz && echo "backup integrity OK"

# 6 · Provider verifiability
cosign verify ghcr.io/markus-barta/paimos:$(docker compose exec paimos cat /app/VERSION) \
  --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github.com/markus-barta/paimos/.+' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer 'https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com'
# Expect: signature verified

# 7 · API openapi presence
curl -sf https://your.host/api/openapi.json | jq '.info.version'
# Expect: matches your VERSION

# 8 · Schema introspection (no auth needed)
curl -sf https://your.host/api/schema | jq '.statuses, .priorities, .types'
# Expect: enum lists

# 9 · CSP-Report-Only is logged or accepted (depending on your sink)
curl -sI https://your.host/api/health | grep -i csp
# Expect: Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only with self-only

# 10 · Health check
curl -sf https://your.host/api/health | jq '.status'
# Expect: "ok"
```

If every command above returns the expected output, the deployment passes the §3 hardening checklist at a structural level. **Operational hardening** (per-user TOTP, project-access review, secret-manager hygiene) requires manual review of the items in §3 that aren't externally observable.

---

## 6 · Common configuration mistakes

Five mistakes operators consistently make. Each one has bitten at least one deployment in this project's history (or a comparable project) — none are theoretical.

1. **Reverse proxy strips the rate-limiter's IP signal.** PAIMOS rate-limits per IP+identity (INV-AUTH-04). If the reverse proxy doesn't forward the original client IP via `X-Forwarded-For` (or whatever header your deployment trusts), every brute-force attempt looks like it comes from the proxy itself — and the rate limit is shared across all users. Fix: configure the proxy to forward the real client IP, and configure PAIMOS / your wrapper to trust it.

2. **`COOKIE_SECURE=true` set without HTTPS.** Browser silently refuses to set the cookie. User logs in, gets a 200, no cookie, next request is unauthenticated, login loop. Fix: only set `COOKIE_SECURE=true` once HTTPS is verified working end-to-end, OR test with the cookie as `Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax` from the proxy side.

3. **`PAIMOS_DEV_MODE=true` left on in staging.** Password-reset links land in `docker compose logs`. Anyone with read-access to the log aggregator can reset any user's password. Fix: set this **only on localhost dev**; never on shared / multi-user instances. Documented as such in [`CONFIGURATION.md`](CONFIGURATION.md).

4. **Backups stored on the same disk as `$DATA_DIR`.** A failed disk takes both the live data and its backups. Fix: backups land on a separate disk minimum, off-site preferred. The deploy script's `$BACKUP_ROOT` should not be a path under `$DATA_DIR`'s parent.

5. **OpenRouter API key shared across dev / staging / prod.** Token usage in dev pollutes prod's daily cap; a leak in dev exposes the prod key. Fix: separate OpenRouter accounts per environment, or at minimum separate keys with separate billing limits per environment.
