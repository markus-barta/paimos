# PAIMOS — Adapter Protocol (PAI-332)

> **Who this is for.** Authors of harness adapters that turn the PAIMOS canonical agent artifact into a skill / commands file for a specific harness (Claude Code, opencode, Flue, a future local-model harness). Per the INSPR thesis: *"None is the foundation of the platform. Each adapter is welcomed; none is owed."*

This document defines the stable, versioned contract every adapter follows. Implement it once, and your adapter slots into `paimos skill render`, the discovery walk, the public registry, and the conformance suite without touching paimos itself.

The contract is **protocol_version `1`**. Breaking changes will bump the major; additive changes are fair game on the same major.

## 1. The shape of the world

```
+---------------+    canonical artifact JSON     +-------------+    rendered file
|  paimos       |  ───────────────────────────>  |  adapter    |  ───────────────>
|  /api/.../    |  via stdin or in-process       |             |  via stdout or
|  agents/...   |                                |             |  in-process
|  .json        |  <───────────────────────────  |             |
+---------------+    suggested path (optional)   +-------------+
```

- **paimos** owns the canonical artifact (PAI-329) and the dispatch layer (`paimos skill render`).
- **The adapter** owns one transform: canonical artifact → harness-specific file.
- The **drift-detection header** on the rendered file is paimos's responsibility — adapters never emit it.

---

## 2. Manifest format

Every adapter ships a v1 manifest. Format: **JSON**.

### Why JSON, not TOML

The ticket left the choice open. We picked JSON because:

- The canonical artifact the adapter consumes is JSON. One syntax across the whole pipeline = one parser, one mental model.
- `paimos-adapter-<name> describe` emits a manifest on stdout. Choosing JSON means in trivial cases the binary can literally `cat paimos-adapter.json`, and external tooling parses one shape (registry, `describe`, on-disk).
- TOML is friendlier for handwritten config but adds a Go dep, two parsers, and a translation layer between disk and wire — net negative for an SDK boundary.

### Canonical shape

```json
{
  "protocol_version": "1",
  "name": "claude-code",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "supports": ">=1.0.0 <2.0.0",
  "description": "Claude Code skill markdown adapter.",
  "target_path_template": "{workspace}/.claude/commands/{slash_command_name}.md",
  "input_format": "json",
  "output_format": "markdown"
}
```

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `protocol_version` | yes (defaulted) | Manifest schema version. `"1"` today. Mismatches are hard errors. |
| `name` | yes | Registry key. Matches `--harness <name>`. Lowercase, hyphen-separated. |
| `version` | recommended | Adapter SemVer. Bump on any output-format change. |
| `supports` | recommended | Bosun-style canonical-artifact range, e.g. `">=1.0.0 <2.0.0"`. paimos's dispatcher rejects mismatches with a clear error before calling render. |
| `description` | recommended | One-line CLI help string. |
| `target_path_template` | recommended | Output path with `{token}` substitution (see below). |
| `input_format` | optional | `"json"` (only value supported today). |
| `output_format` | optional | Hint for file extension: `"markdown" \| "json" \| "yaml" \| "text"`. |

### Path-template tokens

| Token | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `{workspace}` | The user's `--workspace` (default cwd). |
| `{slash_command_name}` | `agent.slash_command_name`, falling back to `agent.name`. |
| `{agent_name}` | `agent.name`. |
| `{project_key}` | `project.key`. |

### Versioning + compat (Bosun-style SemVer)

`supports` is a space-separated AND of clauses (`>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`). Each clause is `<op><M.m.p>`; pre-release tags are tolerated and ignored. paimos refuses to dispatch when the canonical artifact's `canonical_schema_version` falls outside the range, with a clear error that names the adapter and the offending version.

---

## 3. Execution contract

External adapters are standalone executables on disk. Naming convention: `paimos-adapter-<name>`. They MUST implement three verbs:

```sh
paimos-adapter-<name> render --input -            # stdin: canonical, stdout: rendered
paimos-adapter-<name> describe                    # stdout: manifest as JSON
paimos-adapter-<name> validate --input -          # exit 0 iff input is consumable
```

Rules:

- **stdin** receives the canonical artifact JSON exactly as paimos would emit. No envelope, no framing.
- **stdout** carries the rendered file body for `render`, the manifest for `describe`. UTF-8, no BOM. No header line — paimos injects the drift-detection header itself.
- **stderr** carries human-readable diagnostics. On non-zero exit, the **first non-empty line** of stderr is folded into paimos's error message — keep it short and actionable.
- **Exit codes**: `0` on success, non-zero on any failure. paimos does not inspect specific codes today; treat any non-zero as "this attempt failed".
- **Timeout**: paimos kills the subprocess after 30s wall clock. Adapters needing longer should rethink the design.
- **No side effects**. The adapter must be a pure transform — no network, no filesystem writes, no mutation of the input. paimos does the writing.

### `render`

- Read all of stdin. Parse the canonical JSON. Produce the rendered body on stdout.
- Adapters never emit the paimos `<!-- paimos: rendered from … -->` header — paimos's dispatch layer prepends it (PAI-331 reads it for drift detection).
- The suggested output path is computed by paimos from `target_path_template`; the adapter does not need to surface a path.

### `describe`

- Emit the v1 manifest as JSON to stdout. The simplest valid implementation is `cat paimos-adapter.json`.
- The conformance suite verifies that `describe` output parses as a v1 manifest and that `name` + `supports` match the on-disk manifest.

### `validate`

- Read stdin. Exit `0` if the input is something this adapter could consume; non-zero with a one-line stderr summary if not.
- This is the cheap pre-check `paimos skill render` runs before delegating the real call. Use it to catch missing fields, wrong canonical schema, etc.

## 4. Discovery: `$PAIMOS_ADAPTER_PATH`

paimos finds adapters by walking `$PAIMOS_ADAPTER_PATH` — same shape as `$PATH` (colon-separated on POSIX, semicolon on Windows; ordered, first-match-wins).

Layout for each entry:

```
$PAIMOS_ADAPTER_PATH/<name>/
├── paimos-adapter.json          # the manifest
├── paimos-adapter-<name>        # the executable (chmod +x)
└── expected_output.txt          # optional snapshot fixture for the conformance suite
```

The walk is **shallow** (one directory deep) — paimos doesn't recursively crawl arbitrary trees, so adapter discovery I/O is bounded.

### Discovery layers, in order

1. **Built-in registry** — paimos ships `claude-code` today. Always wins on a literal name match unless overridden.
2. **`$PAIMOS_ADAPTER_PATH` directories** — discovered adapters can shadow built-ins by name (the user installed a custom version on purpose).
3. **`paimos skill render --harness-from-file <path>`** — per-invocation override. Wins over both above.

A bad manifest in one directory doesn't hide its siblings; paimos logs the parse error and moves on.

---

## 5. Conformance suite

```sh
paimos skill test-adapter <name>
```

The suite runs every adapter (in-process or external) through standardised cases. A passing run is the gating criterion for listing in the public registry.

### Cases

| Case | What it asserts |
| --- | --- |
| `manifest_sanity` | Manifest parses as v1, has `name`, MarshalJSON round-trip stable. |
| `supports_boundary_lower_inclusive` | Synthesised canonical at `supports`'s lower bound renders. |
| `supports_boundary_middle` | Canonical mid-range renders. |
| `supports_boundary_upper_exclusive` | Canonical at the exclusive upper bound is **rejected** (no silent truncation). |
| `representative_render` | A fully-populated artifact yields non-empty content. |
| `describe_matches_manifest` | (External adapters only) `describe` JSON parses as v1 and matches the on-disk `name` + `supports`. |
| `snapshot_byte_equality` | (Optional) Render of a probe artifact equals `expected_output.txt` byte-for-byte. |

Exit `0` when every case passes; `1` otherwise. Use `--json` for machine-readable output. Use `--snapshot <path>` to run the byte-equality case explicitly.

### Listing in the public registry

`GET /api/registry/adapters` returns every published adapter with its v1 manifest. The static index lives at `backend/handlers/adapter_registry.json` in this repo — submit a PR adding your entry. Default response hides entries with `"conformance.passes": false`; pass `?include=pending` to see in-flight submissions.

## 6. Writing your first adapter

Worked example: `paimos-adapter-claude-code` is the external reference implementation at `https://github.com/inspr-at/paimos-adapter-claude-code`. Paimos still ships a bundled `claude-code` fallback so existing `paimos skill render --harness claude-code` calls continue to work when no external adapter is installed. To build a different external adapter, mirror the bundled fixture at `backend/cmd/paimos/adapters/fixtures/opencode/`.

### Step 1: write the manifest

Create `paimos-adapter.json`:

```json
{
  "protocol_version": "1",
  "name": "myharness",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "supports": ">=1.0.0 <2.0.0",
  "description": "My-Harness skill renderer.",
  "target_path_template": "{workspace}/.myharness/skills/{slash_command_name}.md",
  "input_format": "json",
  "output_format": "markdown"
}
```

### Step 2: write the executable

Name it `paimos-adapter-myharness`. Any language works — Go, Python, Node, even a POSIX shell script (the bundled opencode fixture is one). Implement the three verbs from §3.

The simplest possible Python sketch:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json, sys

def main():
    verb = sys.argv[1]
    if verb == "describe":
        with open("paimos-adapter.json") as f:
            sys.stdout.write(f.read())
        return 0
    if verb == "validate":
        try:
            data = json.load(sys.stdin)
            if not data.get("agent", {}).get("name"):
                print("missing agent.name", file=sys.stderr)
                return 1
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"input parse: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
            return 1
        return 0
    if verb == "render":
        data = json.load(sys.stdin)
        agent = data["agent"]
        sys.stdout.write(f"# {agent['name']}\n\n{agent.get('body', '')}\n")
        return 0
    print(f"unknown verb: {verb}", file=sys.stderr)
    return 64

sys.exit(main())
```

Make it executable (`chmod +x`).

### Step 3: install on `$PAIMOS_ADAPTER_PATH`

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.paimos/adapters/myharness
cp paimos-adapter.json paimos-adapter-myharness ~/.paimos/adapters/myharness/
export PAIMOS_ADAPTER_PATH="$HOME/.paimos/adapters"
```

### Step 4: verify discovery

```sh
paimos skill list-adapters
```

Your adapter shows up next to the built-in `claude-code`.

### Step 5: run conformance

```sh
paimos skill test-adapter myharness
```

When every case passes, you're ready to submit a PR adding your adapter to `backend/handlers/adapter_registry.json` for public listing.

### Step 6: render a real skill

```sh
paimos skill render \
  --project ACME \
  --agent qa \
  --harness myharness
```

The rendered file lands at the path your `target_path_template` resolves to, with the paimos drift-detection header on top. Re-run with `--check` to verify the file is in sync with paimos.
